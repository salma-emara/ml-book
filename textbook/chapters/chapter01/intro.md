# Chapter 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a core field within artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed. This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts that form the basis for all machine learning systems.

You will explore:

- What machine learning is and why it matters  
- The different types of learning paradigms  
- The typical ML workflow and its key steps  
- The essential mathematical background for model training  

Whether you're analyzing datasets or building predictive models, understanding these foundations is essential before diving into advanced ML techniques.
