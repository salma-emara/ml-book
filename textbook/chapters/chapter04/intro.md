# Chapter 4: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction plays a crucial role in data analysis and machine learning. When working with high-dimensional data, we often encounter problems such as:

- High computational cost
- Difficulty in visualization
- Overfitting due to irrelevant or redundant features

PCA is a fundamental tool that transforms the original high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space by identifying the directions (principal components) along which the data varies the most.

This chapter introduces:

- The motivation for reducing the dimensionality of data
- The geometric and statistical intuition behind PCA
- Mathematical derivations using covariance and eigenvalue decomposition
- The step-by-step algorithm for PCA
- Practical considerations and applications

We focus entirely on **linear methods**, especially PCA, and demonstrate how it can be used for both **data compression** and **interpretation**.

---
Throughout the chapter, we aim to build both an intuitive and mathematical understanding of PCA, supported by practical code and figures.
