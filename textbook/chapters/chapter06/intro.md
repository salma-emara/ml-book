# Gradient Descent and Classification with Confidence

This chapter addresses the process of **training classifiers** and the underlying principles of optimization used in practice.  
We begin with the general setup of empirical risk minimization, then proceed to the study of **gradient-based optimization** as a practical method.  

The discussion extends to issues of **confidence in classification**, **calibration of decision boundaries**, and a set of **practical considerations** that influence training outcomes such as initialization, learning rates, and regularization.

Our objective is to connect theoretical principles with their algorithmic implementations in machine learning systems.
