# Biological Motivation

**<span style="font-size:1.5em;">Why Study Neural Networks?</span>**

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are inspired by **biological neural systems**.  
The goal is not to replicate biology perfectly, but to **abstract useful principles** that help in designing computational models capable of learning from data.

**<span style="font-size:1.5em;">Biological Neuron</span>**

A biological neuron consists of:
- **Dendrites**: receive input signals,  
- **Cell body (soma)**: processes the signals,  
- **Axon**: transmits the output signal,  
- **Synapses**: connections with other neurons, with *adjustable strength*.  

This architecture motivates the structure of an **artificial neuron**, where:
- inputs = dendrites,  
- weighted sum = soma,  
- activation function = firing mechanism,  
- output = axon.
