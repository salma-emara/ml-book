# Generalization in Machine Learning

**<span style="font-size:1.5em;">Introduction</span>**

In this chapter, we focus on one of the most fundamental questions in machine learning:

> **Does a trained model work well on unseen data?**

This property is called **generalization**, and it lies at the heart of successful learning systems. A model that merely memorizes training data may perform poorly when exposed to new inputs. Conversely, a model that generalizes well can make reliable predictions in real-world scenarios.

We will explore:
- The definition and importance of generalization.  
- The challenges of **underfitting** and **overfitting**.  
- The **biasâ€“variance tradeoff** as a theoretical lens.  
- The role of **model capacity and complexity** in selecting the right architecture.  
- Key strategies such as **regularization** and **validation methods** to improve generalization.

Ultimately, generalization connects the theory of learning with practical model design, ensuring that machine learning systems remain useful beyond their training data.
