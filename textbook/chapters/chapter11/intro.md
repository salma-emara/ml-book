# Chapter 11: Sequence Data Analysis

**<span style="font-size:1.5em;">Introduction</span>**

Sequence data appears in many domains such as text, audio, sensor readings, and video frames. The key property of these datasets is that the order of elements carries important information. Past observations influence future behavior, making sequence inputs different from fixed-size independent data.

Standard feedforward networks are not designed to handle temporal structure or variable-length inputs. Sequence analysis therefore relies on models that can process data step by step and maintain relevant information across time.

This chapter introduces the main ideas in sequence learning and sets up the following sections:

10.1. Challenges with Temporal or Sequential Data  
10.2. Sequence Modeling Tasks  
10.3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)  
10.4. Advanced Sequence Models
