# Synthetic vs. Real-World Data

**<span style="font-size:1.5em;">Synthetic vs. Real-World Data</span>**

Real-world data is collected directly from natural processes, sensors, users, or environments. It reflects true variability, noise, and complexity. However, it can be expensive to gather, limited in quantity, and sometimes incomplete or biased.

Synthetic data is generated by a model that approximates the real data distribution.  
If the true distribution is $p_{\text{data}}(x)$, synthetic data comes from a learned distribution $p_{\theta}(x)$:

$$
x_{\text{synthetic}} \sim p_{\theta}(x)
$$

The goal is to make $p_{\theta}(x)$ close to $p_{\text{data}}(x)$ so that synthetic samples exhibit similar structure and diversity.  
A common approach is to choose parameters that maximize likelihood:

$$
\theta^{*} = \arg\max_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log p_{\theta}(x^{(i)})
$$

Synthetic data is useful when real data is scarce, expensive, or sensitive. It also supports tasks such as simulation, model testing, augmentation, and controlled experimentation.

Real data captures authentic complexity.  
Synthetic data offers flexibility and unlimited quantity.  
Generative models aim to close the gap between the two by learning faithful approximations of real-world distributions.
