# Applications of RL

**<span style="font-size:1.5em;">Applications of RL</span>**

Reinforcement Learning is used in problems where an agent must make a sequence of decisions and learn from interaction. RL applications appear anywhere trial-and-error learning, sequential control, or long-term reward optimization are required.

Common domains include:

**Robotics and Control**

- navigation  
- motion control  
- manipulation tasks  
- continuous feedback learning  

Robots learn behaviors by interacting with their environment and improving performance over time.

**Game Playing**

- board games  
- strategy games  
- video games  

Agents learn to plan ahead, evaluate long-term outcomes, and optimize complex action sequences.

**Recommendation and Personalization**

- adaptive recommendations  
- content ranking  
- user interaction optimization  

The agent learns to maximize long-term engagement or utility.

**Autonomous Systems**

- self-driving decisions  
- scheduling and planning  
- multi-agent coordination  

These tasks require handling uncertainty and optimizing long-horizon objectives.

**Operations and Resource Management**

- dynamic allocation  
- inventory control  
- traffic management  
- network or power-grid control  

RL methods learn policies that adapt to changing conditions while aiming for optimal long-term performance.

Reinforcement learning is well-suited for complex sequential decision problems where outcomes unfold over time and direct supervision is unavailable.
